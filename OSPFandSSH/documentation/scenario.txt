VLAN setup on all switches
	Admin(VLAN 10)
	HR(VLAN 20)
	IT (VLAN 30)

assign access ports on PCs to correct VLAN
configure trunk port toward router

configure subinterfaces on each router's trunk port: 
	g0/0.10	-> VLAN 10 -> 192.168.10.1/24
	g0/0.20 -> VLAN 20 -> 192.168.20.1/24
	g0/0.30 -> VLAN 30 -> 192.168.30.1/24

configure OSPF on all routes using process ID 1.
advertise all VLAN subnets and inter-router link networks.
verify routing with show ip route and ping access routers.

configure each router
	hostname, domain name and RSA keys
	local login user: admin/cisco123
	ssh version 2
restrict VTY to ssh only	
test ssh from PC in the IT department


summary :
VLAN on all switches
inter-VLAN routing via router-on-a-stick
OSPF between the routers
ssh remote access to all routers
switchport port-security & mac-address sticky
